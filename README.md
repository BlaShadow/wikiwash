A project by [The Working Group](http://twg.ca), in collaboration with
[the Center for Investigative Reporting](http://www.centerforinvestigativereporting.org/) and
[Metro News](http://metronews.ca/), and made possible by [Google Canada](http://googlecanada.blogspot.ca/).

## Installation & Development

```
# Pull the code
$ git clone git@github.com:twg/wikiwash.git
$ cd wikiwash

# Fetch package dependencies
$ npm install
$ bower install

# Launch the dev server
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:3000/
```

WikiWash requires [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) which can be installed either
by downloading the installer or by using a package manager.

Installation on Mac OS X is easiest with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
# make sure you have node installed
$ brew install node
```

WikiWash has been developed on Mac OS X and deployed on Linux, but in theory,
should work on any operating system. If you've tried running WikiWash on your
own machine, feel free to edit this README to update the above instructions.

pull request to merge changes back into the application.

## Deployment

To deploy WikiWash to your own servers, you'll have to set up
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) on your own servers and change
[ecosystem.json](https://github.com/twg/wikiwash/blob/master/ecosystem.json)
to point at your new server environments. Once that's done, deployment is as
simple as:

```
$ bin/pm2 deploy production
```

Note that WikiWash integrates well with [Till](https://github.com/psobot/till),
a cache server that helps speed up page requests from Wikipedia. Setting up a
Till server is not required, but will make WikiWash noticeably faster for
frequently-accessed pages. (An example configuration file for Till is included
at `example/till.config.example.json`.)

WikiWash also includes two example cronjobs (`wikiwash-fetch.cron` and
`wikiwash-cache.cron`) that can run in the background to speed up WikiWash and
to display the most-read Wikipedia articles from the last hour. Note that
these cronjobs call scripts in the `scripts` folder, and do download large
amounts of data from Wikimedia's dump server.
